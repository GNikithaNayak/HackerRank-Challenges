/***
CHALLENGE:
The factorial of the integer n, written n!,is defined as:
n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*3*2*1
Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

Function Description:
Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.
extraLongFactorials has the following parameter(s):
n: an integer
Note: Factorials of n>20 can't be stored even in a 64-bit long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.
We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.

Input Format:
Input consists of a single integer n

Output Format:
Print the factorial of n.
