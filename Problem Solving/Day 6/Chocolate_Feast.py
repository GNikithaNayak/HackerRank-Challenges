# CHALLENGE:

# They are having a promotion at Penny Auntie. 
# If Bobby saves enough wrappers, he can turn them in for a free chocolate.

# Function Description:
# Complete the chocolateFeast function in the editor below.
# chocolateFeast has the following parameter(s):
#   int n: Bobby's initial amount of money
#   int c: the cost of a chocolate bar
#   int m: the number of wrappers he can turn in for a free bar

# Returns:
# int: the number of chocolates Bobby can eat after taking full advantage of the promotion
# Note: Little Bobby will always turn in his wrappers if he has enough to get a free chocolate.

# Input Format:
# The first line contains an integer, t, the number of test cases to analyze.
# Each of the next t lines contains three space-separated integers: n, c, and m.
# They represent money to spend, cost of a chocolate, and the number of wrappers he can turn in for a free chocolate.
