# CHALLENGE:
# When a contiguous block of text is selected in a PDF viewer, the selection is highlighted with a blue rectangle. In this PDF viewer, each word is highlighted independently. 
# There is a list of 26 character heights aligned by index to their letters. For example, 'a' is at index 0 and 'z' is at index 25. There will also be a string. 
# Using the letter heights given, determine the area of the rectangle highlight in mm^2 assuming all letters are 1mm wide.

# Function Description:
# Complete the designerPdfViewer function in the editor below.
# designerPdfViewer has the following parameter(s):
#   int h[26]: the heights of each letter
#   string word: a string
  
# Returns:
# int: the size of the highlighted area

# Input Format:

# The first line contains 26 space-separated integers describing the respective heights of each consecutive lowercase English letter, ascii[a-z].
# The second line contains a single word consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters.
